NAME
    MooX::SetOnce - write-once attributes for Moo

SYNOPSIS
      package MyClass;
      use Moo;
      use MooX::SetOnce;

      has attr => ( is => 'rw', once => 1 );

DESCRIPTION
    MooX::SetOnce creates attributes that are not lazy and not set, but that
    cannot be altered once set.

    The logic is very simple: if you try to alter the value of an attribute
    with the SetOnce trait, either by accessor or writer, and the attribute
    has a value, it will throw an exception.

    If the attribute has a clearer, you may clear the attribute and set it
    again.

    If a Moose module extends or composes a module using MooX::SetOnce,
    MooseX::SetOnce will be loaded to provide the Moose implementation.
